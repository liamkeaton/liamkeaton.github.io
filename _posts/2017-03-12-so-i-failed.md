Last year I had one focus: Get a six pack by the end of 2016.

I’m not sitting here with a chiseled set of abs, so I failed to reach my goal.

Although I’m not happy I failed, it wasn’t all bad. I lost 15kg (33lbs) and reduced my body fat by 10%! I can even run a half marathon 15 minutes quicker than my previous personal best (set over 10 years ago).

A pretty successful failure.

# So what have I learnt?

## Nutrition was, and still is, my biggest challenge

Before starting my six pack challenge I thought the hardest part would be the exercise involved. The hours sweating in a gym or running around a park was daunting. What I didn’t anticipate was how much my nutrition would have to change, and how much willpower it would take.

## Professionals can help you past your plateaus

Halfway through the year I’d lost the majority of weight and hit a plateau where I wasn’t loosing any more. With the help of a trainer I worked on increasing my muscle mass which got my weight moving again. Without the help of a professional I may of been demoralised enough to give up.

## Do something, anything, everyday

I wrote this in my first article and it’s a great rule I still stick by. It helps keep consistency in my training even when I’m feeling lazy or have little time. I’ve built many small habits that have snowballed into bigger changes.

# So what’s next?

I’ve been using bodyweight exercise a lot as it fits the “Do something, anything, everyday” rule well. You don’t need equipment and you can do it anywhere, for any amount of time.

For 2017 I want to take my calisthenic practice further and learn to perform a free standing handstand. Building strength and stability in my shoulders and my core. It’s a great manoeuvre to continue my quest for a six pack and with the help of the School of Calisthenics and their Handstand Program I’ve already made great progress.
