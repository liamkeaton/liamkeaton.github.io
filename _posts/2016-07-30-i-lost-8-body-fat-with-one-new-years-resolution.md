I have always dabbled with lots of new years resolutions, packed with lofty goals and hard to reach achievements. I have also failed to tick off much from these lists.

This year I focused on one goal: Get a six pack by the end of 2016.

A vain and superficial goal but one that would mean big changes to my diet, my exercise, and ultimately my body.

Half a year in and Iâ€™ve lost 8% body fat and 13 kg. I feel fitter and healthier than ever and my original goal is still fixed firmly in my mind.

Here are two techniques that have helped me.

# 1. Start Big

Wanting to see progress straight away I started big with my diet. Following the Slow-Carb Diet by Tim Ferriss I ditched the carbs and upped my protein intake. Using MyFitnessPal I tracked everything I ate and drank, adjusting my diet to fit the macro and calorie goals I set.

As I was cutting carbs I joined Dry January and abstained from alcohol for a month. Even a couple of beers would bring me close to my carb and calorie limits so forgoing booze meant tastier meals.

Although some of these changes were not sustainable (who wants to eat tuna and soup all their life) it did show me quick progress. Also by playing with my macro and calorie goals I have landed on a healthier more sustainable diet now.

# 2. Do Something, Anything, Everyday

Starting big was great but I knew to sustain my six pack once I had it I needed to live an all round healthier life. I started adding small habits, things in my schedule that I do everyday. Things to become routine, done without questioning, like brushing your teeth.

Two habits that have stuck well are Yoga every morning (with Yoga Studio) and exercise every evening (body weight exercises that can be done anywhere). I set no limits on duration or difficulty, I have to just do something, anything, no excuses.

As there are no limits you have no excuses. If you get in late just do 5 push ups, although I find once I am doing them I remember my goal and finish up the routine anyway.

# Whats next?

Starting big helped me to stay motivated through the first few months and my daily habits have kept me exercising everyday without fail.

I would like to lose another 5% body fat so I am planning more challenges to give me a few smaller milestones to push for and get me closer to my resolution. I also plan to add more to my daily routine increasing the amount of healthy habits I achieve daily.
