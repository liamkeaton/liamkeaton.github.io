## Landing

What we hadn't been told about Wellington was how windy the place was but as the plane skidded across the sky we were very aware. After what seemed like an age the plane landed safely and we were hunting through the airport for the designated Uber pick up point. We arrived at the top of Cuba Street and after meeting our host to collect the keys to the apartment were soon travelling up on a lift to our new home. The small studio flat created by adding a mezzanine floor to some spare space, it had a bare but industrial feel to it. With a kitchen, tiny bathroom and views out across the city. We also had a roof terrace with 360 views across the capital, the wind hadn't subsided so we stayed away from the edge.


## Hell Pizza

After spending the previous 10 days in the back of a car we were happy to be spending the night in a warm apartment with a real bed. The small studio flat also had a washing machine which we eagerly filled with all the clothes we were not wearing. Deciding to get an early night we were pleased to find a takeaway pizza joint within spitting distance. Hell Pizza, as the name suggests, was quite macabre with skulls and skeletons adorning the boxes. It was great! We later found it was a popular chain in New Zealand and would recommend it to any weary traveller.


## Cuba Street

Our apartment was at the top of Cuba Street, a street lined with artisan shops and restaurants. Following this road leads you into the main town. We spent quite a bit of time heading up and down this road going for lunch or just for a coffee. Window shopping mainly as we had no room in our bags for souvenirs. Fidel's Cafe was where we tried a Golden Latte for the first, and last, time. A Golden Latte is where turmeric is added to milk to produce what I can only describe as curried milk. The health benefits are not enough for me to stomach another one.


## Fireworks

We had the pleasure to be in Wellington for Guy Fawkes night and their annual fireworks display. With the wind in Wellington being rather extreme they added backup dates to the posters, and even an hour before the show were uncertain whether it would go ahead. We made our way to the harbour despite this and it turned out the wind was on our side and the show went ahead as planned. It was rather spectacular, as fireworks over water can be and it was a rather fitting end to our time in Wellington.


## Bus

On our last day we donned our packs and headed for a long but quite beautiful walk to the Train Station. The walk took through Cuba Street and the main town to the Water front. We walked along the water front past the ferry terminals to the Train station where we would catch our bus. It was a grand building with columns and vaulted ceilings housing the usual news agents and food stands. After picking up some snacks for the journey we went to the side of the building where our bus would be picking us up for the long journey across the north island to Auckland.
