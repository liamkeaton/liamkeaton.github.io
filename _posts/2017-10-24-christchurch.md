## Arrival

We landed in Christchurch in the afternoon, the sun was shinning but the air had lost its heat. After many weeks in East Asia we were used to a more temperate climate. We took the bus from the small airport down town passing small estates of bungalows and parks. If it weren't for the corrugated iron roofs you could have sworn you were in the UK. As we entered the town centre, the grid system and small square retail units reminded you much more of the USA.


## Breakfree

Our hotel was on Cashel Street, one of the main high streets in Christchurch although it looked a little empty at our end with roadworks blocking the end of the road. The building was quite narrow at the front but stretched back quite far making for long corridors and rooms without windows. Our room was small, even to Singapore standards, and had a slightly elevated bed to provide for storage underneath. In one corner of the room was a frosted glass pod containing the shower and toilet. A slightly out of place high tech alarm clock system was built into the bed that provided a sun lamp simulating sunrises and sunsets to fight against jet lag. As an added, rather random, bonus the lights in the bath pod could change colour bathing the room in disco style colours.


## Earthquake

Being quite naive of the earthquake that devastated Christchurch in 2011 we were soon made aware of the destruction. Six years later roads and buildings still showed signs of the damage that had occurred. The shipping container mall that was setup as a temporary space for shops and banks were still being used, although many had moved out to more permanent shopping centres. The most shocking was the Cathedral that had been left with its roof caved in, grave yard over grown and with hoardings surrounding it. All new buildings that had emerged since the earthquake had diagonal braces throughout their structures, often very visible, reminding you that they always had to prepare for the next one.


## C1 Expresso

One morning we stopped at quirky coffee place for breakfast. The building was a grade affair with high ceilings and wood lined walls, but with a twist. Pneumatic tubes filled the air in a novel burger delivery system. Every now and then a metal tube would shoot over head in these tubes delivering burgers and fries to a table. On top of this the drinks fountain was an old dentists fountain and the toilets were hidden behind a moving bookcase. The food and drinks were well presented, especially the loose leaf tea which came in a match box with two halves, one for now and the other for later. Another trick they pulled off was being about to remember who ordered what. It was a large busy place with a garden but still our order arrived at our table without a number or token in sight.


## Trams

I've a hatred of trams. They are neither a bus nor a train. They are a hideous silent hybrid that sneak up you wounding the road with metal scars. Needless to say I didn't think I would enjoy the tram ride. After climbing onto the wooden carriage of the 100+ year old imported tram we slowly crept around the city. The conductor gave great descriptions of the buildings as we passed and filled us in on the history as well as the future plans for the city. Much of the line passed road works and construction, having to stop so it could be let through gates every so often. I am still not a fan of trams, but I would much prefer to be inside of one than being chased by them.


## Leaving

Our brief stay in Christchurch ended the same way it started, with a bus ride. It was a lovely sunny day as we travelled out to an industrial estate just near the airport to pick up our home for the next week or so.
