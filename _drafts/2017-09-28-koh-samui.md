## Accommodation

A short ferry from Koh Phangan took us to Koh Samui. Larger and more developed than it's neighbor, everything seemed to stem from the main road that circled the island. We took a taxi from the pier to our apartment, a modern chalet bungalow type affair just off Bang Por beach. It boasted a kitchen and air conditioning, it was certainly more removed from nature than the beach hut.


## Beach running

Bang Por beach was a long thin strip of sand about 2 miles long dotted with restaurants, accommodation and spas. After a little investigation on the first day we donned our trainers and went for a run. As we were staying slap bang in the middle of the beach we had a choice of 2 mile routes to take, left our right. On the last full day there I braved the full 4 mile round route in 30 degree heat, made easier with a dip in the sea to finish.
