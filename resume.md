## Achievements

Abstracted the API data layer of an Angular application to a vanilla JavaScript SDK. Developers could use the SDK to create quick prototypes, embed within mobile applications and eventually migrate or upgrade the Angular application more easily.

Automated the development, build and deployment chain using Grunt and JavaScript. Deployments became easier and repeatable and onboarding new developers with the codebase went from a few days to a few hours.

Codified a complete high availability infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation. New environments could be stood up within minutes and during load testing changes to EC2 and RDS instances could be quickly applied and tested.
