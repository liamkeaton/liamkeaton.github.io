## Achievements

Codified a complete high availability infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation. New environments could be stood up within minutes and during load testing changes to EC2 and RDS instances could be quickly applied and tested.

Abstracted the data layer of an Angular application to a vanilla JavaScript SDK. Developers could use the SDK to create quick prototypes, embed within mobile applications and eventually migrate or upgrade the Angular application more easily.

Automated a development, build and deployment chain. Deployments became easier and repeatable and onboarding new developers with the codebase went from a few days to a few hours.
