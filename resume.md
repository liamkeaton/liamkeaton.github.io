Over 10 years web development experience, leading teams and projects across the full open source web stack (Linux, PHP, Python, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS).

I have developed PHP websites so Cancer Research UK can receive donations, kept servers running smoothly for Tesco Mobile's two million monthly visitors, and built JavaScript applications that advertise how Google Insights can help businesses.
